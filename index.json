This is increasingly so in digital markets where many firms offer a large product variety. In these markets, consumers purchase products repeatedly, making customer retention an important aspect for firm performance. In this paper, we study the interplay between these two variables, product variety and customer retention. First, we provide a novel game-theoretic model to analyze this interplay and also determine how the optimal product variety depends on the market environment. Second, we empirically test the resulting predictions using data for video games from Steam. Our data set comes with accurate measures of the key variables in our game-theoretic model and additionally contains plausible instrumental variables for empirical identification. We show theoretically that investment in product portfolio size and investment in customer retention are substitutes because the former increases demand from switching consumers whereas the latter increases the repurchase probability of current consumers. We then derive predictions on how market conditions determine a firm's product variety, for which we find ample evidence in our empirical analyses: There is (i) a negative relation between product portfolio size and customer retention, (ii) an inverted u-shape relationship between market value and product variety, and (iii) a positive relation between consumer heterogeneity and product variety. Both our theoretical and empirical results are robust to a wide set of robustness checks.","tags":null,"title":"The Interplay Between Product Variety and Customer Retention: Theory and Evidence","type":"wp"},{"authors":["Reinhold Kesler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666742400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666742400,"objectID":"8670b9e16449a2dad008e0366d2bf453","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/wp/att_22/","publishdate":"2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/wp/att_22/","section":"wp","summary":" ","tags":[],"title":"The Impact of Apple's App Tracking Transparency on App Monetization","type":"wp"},{"authors":["Morgane Cure","Matthias Hunold","Reinhold Kesler","Ulrich Laitenberger","Thomas Larrieu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1664582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1664582400,"objectID":"7c1aa151f2842f85bb0bfedc5606db0f","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/publication/qme_22/","publishdate":"2022-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/qme_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-search platforms, which enable consumers to compare product prices between different sales channels, are sometimes integrated with certain channels. A case in point is the online hotel booking industry where the major online travel agencies are integrated with meta-search platforms. Studying web-scraped data from the meta-search platform Kayak, we find indications that, for a given hotel, the offers of affiliated online travel agents (like Booking.com) are more visible than those of other online travel agents with the same price. Moreover, hotels appear to be less prominent in Kayak’s search results when the rival online travel agent Expedia has the lowest price.","tags":null,"title":"Vertical Integration of Platforms and Product Prominence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Irene Bertschek","Reinhold Kesler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661990400,"objectID":"64ec286dd26a3a2ddd3f93b30455853a","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/publication/iep_22/","publishdate":"2022-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iep_22/","section":"publication","summary":"Social media open up new possibilities for firms to exploit information from various external sources. Does this information help firms to become more innovative? Combining firm-level survey data with information from firms’ Facebook pages, we study the role that firms’ and users’ activities on Facebook play in the innovation process. We find that firms’ adoption of a Facebook page as well as feedback from users are positively and significantly related to product innovations. Our results withstand a large set of robustness checks, including estimations that take potential endogeneity of firms’ Facebook use as well as unobserved heterogeneity into account. Analyzing the content of firm posts and user comments reveals that Facebook adoption is only correlated with product innovations if firms and users actively participate in a discussion, especially when engagement is above-average and comes from both sides.","tags":null,"title":"Let the User Speak: Is Feedback on Facebook a Source of Firms' Innovation?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rebecca Janssen","Reinhold Kesler","Michael Kummer","Joel Waldfogel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1652054400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652054400,"objectID":"2fae0efccd3a89ff7f7bc61f39de01c4","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/wp/nber_22/","publishdate":"2022-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/wp/nber_22/","section":"wp","summary":"Using data on 4.1 million apps at the Google Play Store from 2016 to 2019, we document that GDPR induced the exit of about a third of available apps; and in the quarters following implementation, entry of new apps fell by half.

Comparing long-run equilibria with and without GDPR, we find that GDPR reduces consumer surplus and aggregate app usage by about a third.

Competition authorities did not scrutinize most of these transactions and blocked none. This raised concerns that GAFAM acquisitions target potential competitors yet fly under the radar of current merger control due to the features of the digital economy. We empirically study the competitive effects of big tech acquisitions on competitors in a relevant online market. We identify acquisitions by GAFAM involving apps from 2015 to 2019, matching these to a comprehensive database covering apps available in the Google Play Store. We find that competing apps tend to innovate less following an acquisition by GAFAM, while there seems to be no impact on prices and privacy-sensitive permissions of competing apps. Additionally, we find evidence that affected developers reallocate innovation efforts to unaffected apps and that affected markets experience less entry post-acquisition.","tags":null,"title":"Competitors' Reactions to Big Tech Acquisitions: Evidence from Mobile Apps","type":"wp"},{"authors":["Pauline Affeldt","Reinhold Kesler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618790400,"objectID":"dc8ec6c47a955244a4b5b46a9243797a","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/publication/jeclap_21/","publishdate":"2021-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jeclap_21/","section":"publication","summary":"The current policy discussion over Big Tech Acquisitions debates whether merger control needs to be updated to account for the particular features of digital industries.

We formally characterize how an OTA can use such a strategy to reduce price differentiation across distribution channels. Our empirical analysis shows that the position of a hotel in the search results of OTAs is better when the prices charged by the hotel on other channels are higher. This is consistent with the hypothesis that OTAs alter their search results to discipline hotels for aggressive prices on competing channels, thereby reducing the search quality for consumers.","tags":null,"title":"Rankings of Online Travel Agents, Channel Pricing, and Consumer Protection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Reinhold Kesler","Michael Kummer","Patrick Schulte"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575417600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575417600,"objectID":"84bed0c2d54205c3f0d0c9d7a02b5619","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/wp/zew_19/","publishdate":"2019-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/wp/zew_19/","section":"wp","summary":"Policy makers are increasingly concerned about the combination of market power and massive data collection in digital markets. This concern is fueled by the theoretical prediction that more market power causes firms to collect ever more data from their users. We investigate the relationship between market power and data collection empirically. We analyze data about more than 1.5 million mobile applications in several thousand submarkets of Google’s Play Store. We observe these data for over two years and combine information on an app’s data collection with information about its competitive environment. Our analysis highlights a robust positive relationship between market power and data collection. We find that more data are being collected in concentrated markets, and apps with higher market shares collect more data. This pattern robustly emerges across a series of cross-sectional and panel regressions as well as a series of specifications that exploit exogenous variation.","tags":null,"title":"Competition and Privacy in Online Markets: Evidence from the Mobile App Industry","type":"wp"},{"authors":["Matthias Hunold","Reinhold Kesler","Ulrich Laitenberger","Frank Schlütter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"0348e11403162dc7da06fe439223ba13","permalink":"https://reinholdkesler.github.io/publication/ijio_18/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ijio_18/","section":"publication","summary":"We analyze the best price clauses (BPCs) of online travel agents (OTAs) using meta-search price data of nearly 30,000 hotels in different countries.

In particular, hotels publish their offers more often at Booking.com when the OTA does not use the narrow BPC, and also tend to promote the direct online channel more actively. Moreover, the abolition of Booking.com’s narrow BPC is associated with the direct channel of chain hotels having the strictly lowest price more often.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluation of Best Price Clauses in Online Hotel Bookings","type":"publication"}]
